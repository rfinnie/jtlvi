About

This is the Python 3 reference implementation of JTLVI, a simple binary
message format.


Example

    >>> from struct import pack
    >>> jtlvi.dumps([(1, pack('!I', 123)), (2, b'Hello!')])  # Native format is list of tuples
    b'\xd4\x0e\xc4\xf5\x00\x01\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00{\x00\x02\x00\x06Hello!\xff\xff\x00\x00'
    >>> jtlvi.dumps({999: pack('!f', 1.2)})  # Dicts can also be supplied
    b'\xd4\x0e*q\x03\xe7\x00\x04?\x99\x99\x9a\xff\xff\x00\x00'
    >>> jtlvi.loads(b'\xd4\x0e*q\x03\xe7\x00\x04?\x99\x99\x9a\xff\xff\x00\x00')
    [(999, b'?\x99\x99\x9a')]
